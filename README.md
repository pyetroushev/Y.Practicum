## Game Analysis:
- The online store sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms are available from open sources.
The parameters determining the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed.
A potentially popular product has been identified and advertising campaigns have been planned.
The current period for analysis is selected. Portraits of users of each region have been compiled.
Hypotheses have been tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;
the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres are different.
The Student's criterion for independent samples was used in the analysis.
