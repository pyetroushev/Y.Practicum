## Game Analysis:
 - Studying the patterns that determine the success of games.
- - The online store sells computer games all over the world. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms are available from open sources.
The parameters determining the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed.
A potentially popular product has been identified and advertising campaigns have been planned.
The current period for analysis is selected. Portraits of users of each region have been compiled.
Hypotheses have been tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;
the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres are different.
The Student's criterion for independent samples was used in the analysis.

## Oil Wellfields Analysis:
- - Choosing a region for the development of new oil fields.
- - The mining company needs to decide where to drill a new well.
The characteristics of the oil sample for wells are collected: the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. 
A model has been built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells.
The wells with the highest estimates of values were selected.
The regions with the maximum total profit of the selected wells have been identified.
A model has been built to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. The possible profit and risks are analyzed by Bootstrap technology.

## Gold Recovery:
- - Creation of a prototype model for a metalworking enterprise.
- - The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of the gold mining industry.
A model predicting the recovery coefficient of gold from gold-bearing ore is constructed. The data with the parameters of extraction and purification are analyzed.
A model has been created and trained to help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

## Carprice Prediction:
- - Determining the market value of a used car.
- - The service for the sale of used cars is developing an application to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. 
Analyzed data: technical characteristics, configuration and prices of cars. A model has been built to determine the cost of a used car.
Numerical methods, approximate calculations, algorithm complexity estimation, gradient descent were used.

## Taxi Orders:
- - Forecasting taxi orders.
- - Historical data on taxi orders at airports are analyzed.
The number of taxi orders for the next hour has been predicted to attract more drivers during peak periods.
A model is built for such a prediction.
